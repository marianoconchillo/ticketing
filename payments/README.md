# Payment Service

Is responsible for managing payments using Stripe. It provides a single route to handle payment processing.

## Events

#### ORDER-CANCELLED

This service listens for **ORDER-CANCELLED** events and updates the order to status "Cancelled".

#### ORDER-CREATED

This service listens for **ORDER-CANCELLED** events and replicates the order in its own database.

## Route

#### `POST /api/payments`

Processes a payment using Stripe and emits a new event called **PAYMENT-CREATED**.

##### Request Body

The request body must contain a JSON object with the following fields:

- token - A Stripe token generated by the client.
- orderId - The ID of the order for which the payment is being made.

## Stripe Integration

The Payment Service integrates with Stripe to process payments. When a payment is made, the service creates a new charge in Stripe using the provided token and the order amount.
